# SWOTter
A simple browser based SWOT Analysis tool.

The main motive behind creating SWOTter is to create a SWOT Analysis tool and to get on with things immediately. The secondory or dark motive behind SWOTter is to get my sleeves dirty and learn a bit of learning to create a good user interface.

SWOTter will start as a basic HTML, Angular being and I intend it to make it an online tool for social SWOT Analysis. I hope one day people will be able to use it like pastebin or Gist.

Be free be open forever.
